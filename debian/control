Package: libgtk-vnc-1.0-0
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: A VNC viewer widget for GTK+ (runtime libraries)
 It is built using coroutines, allowing it to be completely asynchronous while
 remaining single threaded. It supports RFB protocols 3.3 through 3.8 and the 
 VeNCrypt authentication extension providing SSL/TLS encryption with x509 
 certificate authentication.
 .
 The core library is written in C and a binding for Python using PyGTK is
 available. The networking layer supports connections over both IPv4 and IPv6.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
