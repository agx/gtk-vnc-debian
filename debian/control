 libgtk-vnc-1.0-0 (<= 0.4.3-1),
Description: VNC GObject wrapper (runtime libraries)
 It is built using coroutines, allowing it to be completely asynchronous while
 remaining single threaded. It supports RFB protocols 3.3 through 3.8 and the
 VeNCrypt authentication extension providing SSL/TLS encryption with x509
 certificate authentication.
 .
 The core library is written in C and a bindings for other languages are
 available via GObject introspection. The networking layer supports connections
 over both IPv4 and IPv6.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
