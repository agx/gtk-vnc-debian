   GTK VNC  Readme
   ===============

gtk-vnc is a project providing client side APIs for the
RFB protocol / VNC remote desktop technology.

It is built using coroutines allowing it to be completely
asynchronous while remaining single threaded. It provides
two core C libraries, libgvnc for interacting with the core
RFB protocol and libgtk-vnc for a GTK display widget.

Access from non-C languages is available using the GObject
Introspection system.

Installation notes
------------------

 * GTK2/GTK3: The build currently defaults to using GTK3.
   To enable legacy GTK2 support the flag '--with-gtk=2.0' must
   be passed to configure.

         ./configure --with-gtk=2.0

   Note that when built against GTK3 the library name for gtk-vnc
   will become 'gtk-vnc-2.0.so' and the pkg-config file will
   also be 'gtk-vnc-2.0', rather than 'gtk-vnc-1.0.so' and 'gtk-vnc-1.0'
   for the GTK2 build.

   The gvnc library is unaffected by GTK2/GTK3 build choice since it
   only depends on GLib/GIO

 * NetBSD: You must run configure using

    --with-coroutine=gthread

   since any app linking against NetBSD's libpthread.so is
   forbidden from using swapcontext() calls, which is gtk-vnc's
   default coroutine impl. For further information see

    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566148
    http://man.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/man-cgi?pthread++NetBSD-current

 * MinGW: The SASL protocol extension is not available on
   this platform
