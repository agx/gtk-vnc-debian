	Fix incompatibility with libvncserver websockets handling
	The previous commit:

	  commit 7f4f2fe8da72ed9fef5dd4319e19feb2b4f3d62e
	  Author: Daniel P. Berrange <berrange@redhat.com>
	  Date:   Thu Jan 26 09:31:40 2017 +0000

	    Add workaround to avoid hangs when connecting to SPICE

	changed the code so that it would send the bytes "RFB " to the
	server before we received its own greeting. This works fine for
	VNC servers which follow the RFB protocol spec exclusively. The
	libvncserver code though tries to implement websockets tunnelling
	support on the same port as the normal RFB service. The way it
	does this is by waiting 100ms after the client connects to see
	if the client sends any data. If the client sends data, then it
	tries to interpret this as an HTTP GET request to initiate the
	websockets connection. This breaks when it sees our "RFB " bytes
	being sent. Ideally the libvncserver would have just run a normal
	RFB connection in this case, but that's not what happens, and
	given the libvncserver code is in the wild we need a workaround.

	So instead of immediately sending the 'RFB ' bytes to the VNC
	server, we introduce a 2 second wait. ie, we'll wait for the
	normal VNC server greeting and if it doesn't arrive after 2 seconds,
	we'll send our 'RFB ' bytes proactively, and continue waiting. If we
	are on a real VNC server, we'll get our connection initialized
	eventually. If connecting to a SPICE server by mistake, we'll get a
	clean disconnect, and we'll avoid upsetting libvncserver, because its
	100ms wait for HTTP GET will have long since finished.

	Report a proper error message if hitting connection timeout

	Fix crash when no error is set after connection failure

	Fix crash when opening connection from a GSocketAddress

	Avoid sign extension warnings from coverity
	 src/vncconnection.c:3082: sign_extension:
	 Suspicious implicit sign extension: "height" with type "unsigned short"
	 (16 bits, unsigned) is promoted in "rowlen * height" to type "int"
	 (32 bits, signed), then sign-extended to type "unsigned long"
	 (64 bits, unsigned). If "rowlen * height" is greater than 0x7FFFFFFF,
	 the upper bits of the result will all be 1.

	The 'rowlen' variable is initialization from the unsigned width
	variable, so should have used uint instead of int.

	Fix inverted args when creating framebuffer for test suite
	The local & remote format args were inverted in the test
	suite. This is currently harmless since we are not trying
	to validate the rendered framebuffer content.

	Restore correct size of reserved data
	A previous commit

	  commit 7a9271620c894931cc22d6587d58e46c5996dac3
	  Author: Lei Li <lilei@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
	  Date:   Mon May 20 11:45:59 2013 +0100

	    Add support for LED state extension to gvnc

	removed 4 elements from the reserved data field, when adding
	one pointer. This is because it mistakenly thought the reserved
	elements were 1 byte in length, when they are in fact one pointer
	in size.

	The original change was technically an ABI incompatible change,
	as is this fix. In practice, however, GObject classes are never
	instantiated statically at compile time. Instead a call to
	g_type_register_static is made at runtime. So this change in the
	class size won't have a negative effect unless someone has
	subclassed the VncConnectionClass type. Even if subclassing, this
	should be harmless as we've merely increased the memory allocation
	by 3 words.

	README: Update URL to home page
	The old page no longer seems to exist in GNOME's wiki.

	Add preconditions to VncDisplay public methods
	This should catch invalid arguments being passed to these. This required
	moving the VncDisplayPrivate *priv = display->priv; assignment as the
	VNC_IS_DISPLAY(display) check is also a NULL check which we want to
	happen before dereferencing it.

	Avoid crash if attempt to connect to an invalid host or port
	If vnc_display_open_host() is called with a NULL port or host,
	vnc_connection_open_host_internal() will eventually crash.
	This commits adds runtime checks to return early with
	g_return_val_if_fail() when this happens rather than
	crashing

	CVE-2017-5884

2017-01-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add workaround to avoid hangs when connecting to SPICE
	When used with QEMU at least, both SPICE and VNC live in the same port
	range (5900+). It is thus not entirely uncommon for a user to mistakenly
	connect to a SPICE server with a VNC client, or vica-verca.

	When connecting to VNC server with a SPICE client, you quickly get an
	error. This is because the VNC server sends its short greeting and then
	sees the RedLinkMess from the SPICE client, realizes its garbage and
	drops the connection.

	When connecting to a SPICE server with a VNC client though, you get an
	indefinite hang. The VNC client is waiting for the VNC greeting, which
	the SPICE server will never send. The SPICE server is waiting for the
	RedLinkMess which the VNC client will never send.

	In VNC the protocol starts with the follow data sent:

	 Server: "RFB 003.008\n"
	 Client: "RFB 003.008\n"

	This can be tweaked so the client proactively sends the first four
	bytes

	 Client: "RFB "
	 Server: "RFB 003.008\n"
	 Client: "003.008\n"

	From the VNC server POV, it'll still be receiving the same 12 bytes from
	the client - it just happens that 4 of them might arrive a tiny bit
	earlier than the other 8 of them. IOW nothing should break in the VNC
	server from this change.

	The SPICE server, waiting for its RedLinkMess message will see these
	four bytes "RFB " and interpret them as the SPICE magic number. This
	will be invalid and so the SPICE server will drop the connection.
	This avoids the VNC client hanging forever when connecting to a SPICE
	server by mistake.

	If using GNUTLS >= 3.0.0, we can fallback to using the
	system trust DB, if no explicit CA cert is provided.

	If an explicit CA is provided, we do *NOT* enable the
	system trust, because we don't want to allow arbitrary
	public CAs to issue bogus certs for VNC servers using
	a dedicated CA.

	Resolves: bz#762223, #768237

	spec: assume Fedora >= 20

	Allow default TLS priority to be set at build time
	Add a --with-tls-priority flag to configure which takes a
	GNUTLS cipher/protocol priority string, overriding the
	built-in default of "NORMAL".

	Drop support for gnutls < 2.2.0
	The 2.2.0 release of gnutls includes gnutls_priority_set_direct
	which we already use conditionally. This release dates from Dec
	2007, so it is reasonable to drop the conditional code for older
	GNUTLS releases.

	The Linux kernel's usb_kbd_keycode translation table oddly enough translates
	2 different USB/HID scancodes to the same Linux KEY_* symbol for a the
	volume mute/up/down and find/stop symbols.  The first of these matches the
	HID usage tables (Hut1_12.pdf), and the second is in the reserved range
	(0xe8-0xffff).

	It is unclear why this is done (the commit predates the move to git), but
	for the reverse table in keymaps.csv it makes sense to use the values from
	the official HID usage tables instead.

	win32: translate virtual-key code to scancode via MapVirtualKey
	Local client keyboard layout shouldn't affect hardware scancode sent
	to guest, so that guest keyboard layout configuration can map it
	properly.

	Unfortunately, the Win32 GdkEventKey.hardware_keycode isn't a hardware
	scancode, but the Windows virtual-key code. We could modify Gdk to
	return the scancode (available in MSG.lParam or via global hook), but
	that would mean some Gdk breakage, or some unnecessary complexity.
	Instead, we can rely on MapVirtualKey(), which translates the
	vitual-key code into a scan code using current keyboard layout.

	  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=594571

	Don't ungrab pointer on leave-notify events
	If we ungrab the pointer on leave-notify events, this breaks
	the automatic grabs when a button is pressed in absolute pointer.
	A symptom of this is that if you press to start highlighting text
	in a gedit window in a server, and move the mouse outside the VNC
	widget and release the button, the server will never see the mouse
	up event. We must preserve grabs upon button press so that the
	VNC server always sees the eventual release events.

	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=664567

	Don't drop mouse events that are out of bounds
	In absolute mode, if the mouse cursor goes outside the bounds
	of the window, we drop the motion event entirely. This is bad
	because only one of the co-ordinates may be out of bounds, and
	the server still wants to see movement in the other axis. Instead
	of dropping the events, just clamp co-ordinates to the boundary.

	Fix typo in NO_UNDEFINED_FLAGS name
	Fix typo in the configuration of the NO_UNDEFINED_FLAGS name for Cygwin.

	test for --no-undefined linker flag
	Currently the code assumes that all non-Windows like platforms have a
	linker that supports --no-undefined, however llvm based compilers do not
	support this on Linux or Mac OS X, so instead test for it and only
	use if it is available.

2013-09-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Reset 'blocking' flag after I/O wait
	If the 'vnc_connection_read_wire' goes into an I/O wait
	due to blocking I/O, the 'blocking' flag gets set to
	true. Upon returning from the wait, it jumps back to
	the start of the function, but does not reset the 'blocking'
	flag to false. If the I/O attempt succeeds, this doesn't
	matter, but if it fails for an error reason, this gets
	mistakenly treated as blocking I/O again.

	This is seen most often when the remote server drops the
	connection. If the client was blocking on I/O at this
	time, it could get into a potentially infinite loop.

	  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=704098

2013-09-13  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Only trigger grab sequence upon release
	GTK-VNC uses the keyboard shortcut ctrl+alt to toggle inside/outside
	the VM (aka release pointer). Now Gnome uses ctrl+alt+arrow_key to
	switch virtual desktops. So these two shortcuts collide and gtk-vnc
	will grab the key presses as soon as ctrl+alt is pressed and toogle
	inside/outside the VM, which makes switching desktops impossible.

	The solution is to only trigger the grab sequence when the user
	releases the key. So if they press Ctrl+alt and then release it,
	we trigger, but if they press Ctrl+alt+left-arrow we don't trigger

	Free coroutine stack when releasing coroutine
	The coroutine_init function mmap's a stack for the
	ucontext coroutine, but nothing ever munmaps it.

	Abort if mmap of coroutine stack fails
	If we fail to mmap the stack, abort the processs rather
	than returning an error. This is standard practice in
	glib apps, and the caller was not checking the
	coroutine_init() return code leading to memory corruption.

	Add missing 'default' case to switch statement

	Disable deprecation warnings
	Glib deprecated GValueArray in favour of GArry

	  gvncviewer.c:450:9: warning: ‘g_value_array_get_nth’ is deprecated (declared at /usr/include/glib-2.0/gobject/gvaluearray.h:65): Use 'g_array_index' instead [-Wdeprecated-declarations]

	Unfortunately these types are not ABI compatible. eg
	compare the field orders

	  struct GValueArray {
	    guint   n_values;
	    GValue *values;
	  };

	vs

	  struct GArray {
	    gchar *data;
	    guint len;
	  };

	So the replacement can't be used without a change in API
	and ABI. This is unacceptable, so the deprecation warniings
	must be disabled :-(

	Avoid crash with unsupported audio formats
	Currently if the VNC server sends an unsupported audio format,
	we skip creating the pulse audio instance. When we later receive
	audio data from QEMU we crash on this NULL instance. Instead we
	should simply discard the audio data. Also log a warning if we
	get a format we can't supported

	Avoid use of uninitialized variables in password echo prompt

	Remove bogus check for 'conn' being null in vnc_connection_is_open

	Fix size check on available write buffer space
	The vnc_connection_write() function did not consider the current
	write offset when calculating how much space was available in
	the write buffer. This could lead to an array overrun.

	Avoid array overrun setting up blt24 function
	If a VNC colourmap mode was enabled, we would attempt to access
	beyond the end of the blt24 function table. There are no blt
	functions that can work for this mode, so just stub out the
	array with NULL, and add a later check for NULL.

	Fix missing check for OOM in python binding by s/malloc/g_new0/

	Fix NULL dereference in debug logging on socket read error

	libraries required to build

2011-12-13  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Include locale.h in gvnccapture.c
	It uses setlocale and LC_ALL, without this header compilation fails
	on RHEL 6.2

	More fixing for gir generation
	I missed the new GVncPulse.gir file in the previous fix

	Fix GIR generation
	Overriding PKG_CONFIG_PATH when generating GtkVnc-2.0.gir is
	wrong since this means that if glib/... is installed in a prefix that
	is not one of the default pkg-config paths, then it won't be found.
	PKG_CONFIG_PATH is overridden so that g-ir-scanner can find GVnc-1.0.gir
	in the build tree. Since g-ir-scanner provides --include-uninstalled
	for that purpose, use that instead.

2011-12-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	emacs magic to files which were missing it. Reindent all
	files with new rules

	Batch up incoming audio samples for upto 100ms
	The length of samples received from the guest can be very
	small (as little as 1 sample). If this is dispatched directly
	to the audio sink this can cause excessive CPU consumption
	and context switching. Batch up incoming data for upto 100ms
	until dispatching it

	data packets

	Remove all audio APIs from VncDisplay since we expose the connection
	Now that there is a vnc_display_get_connection() method there is
	no need to duplicate all the audio APIs & signals in the VncDisplay

	Recent GCC warn about assignments to variables which are then
	not used.

	Introduce pulse audio bridge for GVnc

	emits a signal for each method. This enables apps to support
	audio playback without needing to create subclasses. It also
	isolates subclasses from extensions in the interface

2011-04-14  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix missing OS-X keymapping for letter 'A'
	The keymap-gen.pl script was not correctly distinguishing
	keycodes with a value of '0', from undefined keycodes. All
	were skipped. This meant that the mapping for OS-X ANSI_A
	key was lost (since it has value 0).

	For similar reasons the XQuartz mapping for the letter A
	was also lost.

	* src/keymap-gen.pl: Fix handling of 0 vs undef for keycodes
	* src/keymaps.csv: Remove bogus 0x0 entry in OS-X keymap

	Tweak logging messages for TLS auth sub-types

	* src/vncconnection.c: Remove unused vars

2011-01-28  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Make pointer warp check more robust
	The pointer warp code checks whether the local cursor
	is hitting a boundary == 0, ==width, or ==height. This
	is slightly too strict, it should check <= 0, >= width
	or >= height

	* src/vncdisplay.c: Make boundary check more robust

	Fix warning about unused 'dpy' variable in keymap code
	In GTK2 paths, GDK_IS_*_DISPLAY(dpy) evaluated to '1'
	which meant 'dpy' could be unused. Change it to eval
	to 'dpy == dpy' to trick compiler into thinking the
	variable is in use.

	* src/vncdisplaykeymap.c: Fix warning of unused variable

2011-01-14  George Stefanakis  <george.stefanakis@gmail.com>

	Updated Greek translation

2011-01-13  Sébastien Granjoux  <seb.sfo@free.fr>

	The VncDisplay class forgot to pass the 'shared flag' onto
	the VncConnection class when establishing a connection

2011-01-13  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refactor keymap handling to cope with multiple GDK backends
	In GTK3 it is possible to have multiple GDK backends present.
	The vncdisplaykeymap code needs a minor refactoring to cope
	with this enhancement. The refactoring also trivially maintains
	GTK2 compat

2011-01-05  Akom Chotiphantawanon  <knight2000@gmail.com>

	Added Thai translation.

2010-12-14  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix leak of GSource objects which causes performance problems
	The GLib event loop scales poorly as the number of GSource objects
	increases. A missing unref on the GSource objects used in the VNC
	connection meant that many unused instances accumulated, slowing
	down the event loop processing.

	* src/vncconnection.c: Unref all GSource objects

2010-12-09  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Adapt to avoid further Gtk3 changes
	More gdk_drawable calls have gone away in Gtk3. Adapt code to avoid
	needing to use them, by calling gtk_widget APIs instead.

2010-11-29  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Re-introduce a server side Pixmap to cache framebuffer
	Despite use of clipping during drawing, rendering directly
	from the client side cairo image, to the window incurred
	a serious performance penalty for some users' X servers.
	Re-introduce a server side copy of the VNC desktop using
	a cairo surface, backed by an X Pixmap. This uses cairo
	APIs directly, avoiding any need for GdkPixmap.

	Remove check for Text::CSV
	Revert the check for Text::CSV added in

	  753ddcb203fd9ad26829a065fd4d47c82773e849

	Since the keymap files are now included in EXTRA_DIST, there
	is no requirement fo Text::CSV at end user build time. Only
	maintainers required the Text::CSV file when generating a
	new dist.

2010-11-29  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Fix framebuffer update boundary check
	Framebuffer boundary checks need to take into account offset,
	in addition to width/height

	* src/vncconnection.c: Fix boundary check

	Avoid crash in TLS cleanup code on shutdown
	The gnutls_bye() method may try to send data on the socket todo
	graceful TLS shutdown. The priv->sock variable is possibly
	already NULL at this point if the close was triggered via the
	vnc_connection_shutdown() method. Change the latter so that
	it only calls g_socket_close, not actually free'ing the
	priv->sock object immediately. Also put sanity check code in
	the TLS push/pull functions to catch future bugs in this area

	Distribute built keymap files
	Avoid the need for end users to have the Perl Text::CSV module
	installed, by including the pre-generated keymap source files
	in the dist.

	* gtk-vnc.spec.in: Remove dep on perl(Text::CSV)
	* src/Makefile.am: Include keymaps in dist

	Avoid crash in motion event & vnc_display_get_pixbuf
	If a mouse event occurs before a connection completes setup
	priv->fb will be NULL and a crash can occur. Likewise if
	vnc_display_get_pixbuf() is called before priv->fb is set,
	then a crash occurs. Add checks for NULL in both cases

2010-11-26  Jonh Wendell  <jwendell@gnome.org>

	check for Text::CVS perl module in configure. closes #634621

2010-11-05  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

2010-11-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix data type of arg to cut-text signal in VncConnection
	The vnc-server-cut-text signal is marshalled by

	  g_cclosure_marshal_VOID__STRING

	so its argument must be a 'const char *', not a 'GString *'
	datatype.

	* src/vncconnection.c: Fix data type for cut-text signal arg

2010-10-29  Carles Ferrando  <carles.ferrando@gmail.com>

	Added Catalan (Valencian) translation

2010-10-29  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

2010-10-28  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Enable building of a sub-RPM for gtk3
	Allow a single RPM to build both gtk2 and gtk3 libraries

	* gtk-vnc.spec.in: Add gtk-vnc2 sub-RPM for gtk3 binaries

	Cope with building against newer gobject-introspection
	Newer gobject-introspection wants --symbol-prefix and
	--identifier-prefix instead of --strip-prefix. Test
	for such a version and use the new style options if
	appropriate

	* configure.ac: Check for new gobject introspection
	* src/Makefile.am: Adapt to g-ir-scanner flags

	Fix rendering artifacts when running in scaling mode
	The expose region was not large enough when running in scaling mode
	resulting in horizontal & vertical line artifacts when moving
	windows around on the virtual desktop. The previous fix used in
	Gtk2 was not sufficient for Gtk3, so change the fix to be entirely
	within the on_framebuffer_update handler

	* src/vncdisplay.c: Hack to fix rendering artifacts

	Add compat macro for GDK_DISPLAY
	The GDK_DISPLAY macro is removed in Gtk3, add a compatibility
	macro to allow build with Gtk2 and Gtk3

	* src/vncdisplaykeymap.c: Add GDK_DISPLAY compat

	Add compatability code for GDK symbolic keys
	The GDK key macros were changed from GDK_ to GDK_KEY_ in GTK3.
	Add some compatibility #ifdefs to allow the same macros to be
	used on both Gtk2 and Gtk3.

	* examples/gvncviewer.c: Add GDK_KEY compat
	* src/vncdisplaykeymap.c: Add GDK_KEY compat

2010-10-27  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refactor drawing code to allow compatibility with Gtk3
	In Gtk3, the expose_event is replaced with a 'draw' callback.
	This is provided with a 'cairo_t' context that is already
	configured with the clip region.

	Split the current expose_event into two parts, the first
	which creates a cairo_t based on the GdkEventExpose data,
	and the second method which draws to that cairo_t. The
	expose_event is conditionally disabled for Gtk3 builds,
	just leaving the draw method which works on Gtk2 and Gtk3

	* src/vncdisplay.c: Pull drawing code out of expose_event
	  method and disable expose_event on Gtk3

	Remove the server side framebuffer cached in GdkPixmap
	For rendering efficiency a GdkPixmap was kept on the server
	duplicating what was in the old GdkImage object on the client
	side. The client was changed to use a cairo image surface.
	This can easily be rendered straight to the window and does
	not appear to have any performance degradation. Thus the
	GdkPixmap can be eliminated, avoiding the extra memory usage
	that entails

	* src/vncdisplay.c: Remove the GdkPixmap copy of the framebuffer

	Change cursor to use GDK_BLANK_CURSOR instead of a GdkPixmap
	The GdkPixmap class has been removed in GTK3. Since Gtk 2.16
	there is a standard GDK_BLANK_CURSOR which can replace their
	usage and works across Gtk 2 and 3.

	* src/vncdisplay.c: Use GDK_BLANK_CURSOR

2010-10-25  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Clear out more fields when closing a vnc connection
	Be more paranoid about reseting internal fields when closing
	a VNC connection, to prevent surprises when reconnecting

	* src/vncconnection.c: Clear out more fields when closing
	  a connection

	Add strict bounds checking on framebuffer updates
	Some broken VNC servers send frame buffer updates which stray
	outside the boundary of the desktop. This will lead to memory
	corruption when rendering, so explicitly check for this and
	drop the VNC connection.

	* src/vncconnection.c: Add framebuffer update bounds checking

2010-10-21  Michal Novotny  <minovotn@redhat.com>

	Introduce vnc_util_get_version() functions to get version
	this is the patch to allow user to get the GTK-VNC version using the
	vnc_util_get_version() and vnc_util_get_version_string() functions.
	Both the functions returns the version numbers based on the VERSION
	definition as created by autotools. Also, in version 2 (previous
	version) a new function called vnc_util_check_version() has been added
	to check whether the version of gtk-vnc is equal or higher to version
	requested. Function vnc_util_check_version() is defined as:

	gboolean vnc_util_check_version(gint major, gint minor, gint micro);

	The version of gtk-vnc is written in a "major.minor.micro" format
	and since the version number didn't change once the package was
	compiled version 3 is using VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,MICRO} constants
	being parsed and set by configure itself rather then parsing it
	at run-time.

	Then there are 2 version functions. The difference between those
	functions is that vnc_util_get_version() returns the gint value
	based on bit flags that have to be converted to get the version
	number in the string format. It's designed for further processing of
	the major, minor and release versions.

	If you want to get the version number only (e.g. to let the user
	know the GTK-VNC version he/she is using) you can use the second
	function called the vnc_util_get_version_string() which returns
	the string representation, e.g. 0.4.1.

	For the vnc_util_get_version() function the gint is being returned
	with setting up appropriate bits. You can get the versions using
	following formula:

	ver = vnc_util_get_version();
	major = (ver >> 24) & 0xff;
	minor = (ver >> 16) & 0xff;
	micro = (ver >> 8 ) & 0xff;

	I think this patch could be useful for mainly for reason mentioned
	above. To check whether the user has at least 0.4.1 version of
	gtk-vnc using the vnc_util_check_version(0, 4, 1) is preferred.
	The vnc_util_get_version() function is a low-level function that
	could be useful to get the version number to be converted further.

	Don't close the socket before the coroutine shut down
	The connection shutdown needs the socket intact:

	7  0xb6d38cdf in vnc_connection_tls_push (transport=0x8d84108, data=0x8df33c0, len=229) at vncconnection.c:942
	8  0xb6b30437 in ?? () from /usr/lib/libgnutls.so.26
	9  0xb6b2d12c in _gnutls_send_int () from /usr/lib/libgnutls.so.26
	10 0xb6b4d682 in gnutls_alert_send () from /usr/lib/libgnutls.so.26
	11 0xb6b2d662 in gnutls_bye () from /usr/lib/libgnutls.so.26
	12 0xb6d3a620 in vnc_connection_close (conn=0x8d84108) at vncconnection.c:4323

	so close the socket after the coroutine shutdown. Otherwise it fills the
	console with:

	(gvncviewer:11056): GLib-GIO-CRITICAL **: g_socket_send: assertion `G_IS_SOCKET (socket) && buffer != NULL' failed

	and gets stuck in an endless loop.

	Add missing keytable entry for KEY_KATAKANAHIRAGANA
	* src/keymaps.csv: Add XT code for KEY_KATAKANAHIRAGANA

	Fix auth subtype choosing logic in vncdisplay
	The method for choosing auth subtypes was rather flawed. Rewrite
	it to work correctly. Introduce an explicit list of vencrypt
	subtypes, since these are distinct from main subtypes. Improve
	debug logging in auth choice code.

	* src/vncdisplay.c: Fix auth type choice
	* src/vncconnection.c: Improve auth debugging & invoke correct
	  signal for auth subtype choice

2010-09-08  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Simplify logic in host open code
	The second else clause checks for conn_error != NULL twice and since we
	don't use it to determine the return value we can clear it
	unconditionally.

	* src/vncconnection.c: Simplify logic in vnc_connection_open_host_internal

	Clear error when trying next IP address
	If connecting to an IP address fails, the GError must be

2010-09-02  Jonh Wendell  <jwendell@gnome.org>

	Check if we have an error before reading or writing to the socket

	Check if we have a valid socket before trying to close it
	If we attempt to destroy the widget while VncConnection still
	is trying to connect to the host, then priv->sock is not valid yet.

	Add comment about where each keymap datasource came from
	To assist in people identifying/resolving mistakes, add a note
	about where each data source from keymaps.csv came from. Most
	are from Linux kernel source data tables, a few were manually
	matched up (Xwin/OS-X)

	* src/keymap-gen.pl: Record data sources for keymaps.csv

	Ensure automake maintainer mode is enabled

	Add a cairo based framebuffer implementation
	In GTK3, GdkImage has been removed completely. The vncimageframebuffer
	class cannot thus be used. Replace it with a vnccairoframebuffer
	class instead, but keep the old one around in GTK2 builds for ABI
	compatability.

	* src/vnccairoframebuffer.c, src/vnccairoframebuffer.h,
	  src/libgtk-vnc_sym.version: Add new framebuffer impl
	  based on Cairo.
	* src/Makefile.am: Disable GdkImage based framebuffer on
	  GTK3 builds
	* src/vncdisplay.c: Always use Cairo based framebuffer

	Fix typo in keycode names & improve error message
	Fix typo in evdev keycode names left over from debugging. Improve
	the error message when finding unknown keycodes

	Mandate the use of Cairo for all drawing
	Cairo has been used for GTK drawing for a long time and is now
	mandatory in GTK3. Drop support for non-Cairo drawing ops since
	they're obsolete.

	* configure.ac: Check for Cairo
	* src/vncdisplay.c: Drop non-cairo drawing

	Reset xmit_buffer fields to fix reconnect
	If a vnc_connection object was closed and reopened old data

	Rewrite keymap code to work on more platforms
	The current keymap code assumes an Xorg server on Linux with
	either evdev or kbd drivers. This adds heuristics to detect
	XQuartz (Xorg on OS-X) and XWin (Xorg on Cygwin). Further it
	adds support for native GDK on OS-X and Win32.

	It is not possible to assume that keycodes < 87 have a 1-1
	mapping to RFB (XT) keycodes. Thus the keymap arrays must
	have a complete dataset, all special casing is removed.

	All master  keymaps are defined in a CSV file. THis covers
	Linux keycodes, OSX keycodes, AT set1, 2 & 3, XT keycodes,
	the XT encoding used by the Linux KBD driver, USB keycodes,
	Win32 keycodes, the XT encoding used by Xorg on Cygwin,
	the XT encoding used by Xorg on Linux with kbd driver.

	Further RFB and final Xorg driver mappings are derived
	from these master maps automatically. The keymap-gen.pl
	tool can generate lookup tables between all possible
	keycode sets as required.

	eg To generate a map from native Win32 keycodes to RFB
	keycodes

	   keymap-gen.pl keymaps.csv win32 rfb

	* gtk-vnc.spec.in, mingw32-gtk-vnc.spec.in: Require Text::CSV
	  for generating keymaps
	* src/Makefile.am: Generate keymaps dynamically
	* src/keymap-gen.pl: Tool to generate keymaps from CSV file
	* src/keymaps.csv: Master keymap definitions
	* src/vncconnection.c: Improve keypress log message
	* src/vncdisplay.c: Convert to guint16 for keymap table
	* src/vncdisplaykeymap.c, src/vncdisplaykeymap.h: Use a
	  new dynamically generated, full keymap.

2010-07-20  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Disable extended key events if keymap is unknown
	Currently if we cannot determine the GDK keymap, we default to
	the XT keymap. This is not a good choice because is causes
	definite breakage on several platforms. If the keymap cannot
	be determined, it is safer to disable the extended key event
	support completely & rely on traditional VNC keysyms.

	Also rename the x2pc methods to be gdk2rfb, since that's what
	the conversion is actually doing.

	Change way encodings are disabled at runtime
	The approach for disabling pseudo encodings is fragile because
	it relies on ordering in the array. Rewrite to allow removing
	arbitrary encodings

	Remove all gnulib code
	Since the port to use GIO for sockets, there is no requirement
	for gnulib. Delete it all

	Switch over to use GIO for socket connections / DNS resolution
	GIO provides GSocket and GResolver classes that can replace all
	current use of POSIX sockets / DNS resolution APIs. This gives
	cross platform portability for free, removing the need to use
	gnulib for socket portability

	* configure.ac: Check for GIO
	* src/Makefile.am: Link to GIO
	* src/vncconnection.c: Switch to using GSocket & friends
	* src/vncdisplay.c: Remove winsock initialization code

2010-07-14  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Remove a few uses of stdint in favour of glib int types

	Resync RPM specfiles based on latest Fedora devel

	Update version to 0.4.1

2010-07-13  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix test suite
	* Makefile.am: list files in build-aux instead of wildcarding
	* vc-list-files: Move to build-aux
	* gnulib/lib/Makefile.am: Point to build-aux for vc-list-files
	* gtk-vnc.spec.in: Run tests during RPM build
	* tools/gvnccapture.c: Remove bogus N_ annotation. Not yet
	  ready for i18n support.

	Use separate soname when building against GTK-3
	The GTK-3 library is not ABI compatible with GTK-2. Thus when
	GTK-VNC builds against GTK-3 it is not ABI compatible with a
	build done against GTK-2. It is thus neccessasry to allow for
	parallel install of GTK-2 and GTK-3 builds. This is done by
	changing the library name, pkgconfig name and include file
	locations

	 GTK-2:

	    libgtk-vnc-1.0.so
	    gtk-vnc-1.0.pc
	    /usr/include/gtk-vnc-1.0

	 GTK-3:

	    libgtk-vnc-2.0.so
	    gtk-vnc-2.0.pc
	    /usr/include/gtk-vnc-2.0

	NB, when enabling GTK-3, the traditional python bindings will
	be disabled. The new GObject Introspection support provide an
	alternative python binding for users of GTK-3

	* gtk-vnc-1.0.pc.in: Fix to only use GTK-2
	* gtk-vnc-2.0.pc.in: New for GTK-3 support
	* src/Makefile.am: Different sonames & include dirs when
	  building against GTK3
	* configure.ac: Disable python binding with GTK3
	* README: Add note about GTK3
	* Makefile.am: Install new pkgconfig file for GTK3

2010-07-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix ChangeLog generation
	Cannot assume changelog generation is run directlyin source
	directory

	Add gvncviewer.js to EXTRA_DIST

	Remove GNOME compile warnings checks
	Remove GNOME compile warnings checks, since GTK-VNC already has
	custom checks that are far more aggressive in enabling compile
	warnings. C++ compiler warnings are not required

	Update metadata files ready for new release
	Updated AUTHORS, MAINTAINERS, NEWS, README for new release.

	Autogenerate ChangeLog from GIT logs

	Fix mingw32 RPM specfile
	Add the gvnccapture program to the mingw32 RPM spec

	Fix DLL linking on mingw32
	libtool does not like -Wl,--no-undefined, even though the compiler
	and linker are happy enough. Revert to using -no-undefined on
	mingw32 platforms. Also use the correct style of linker script
	for exporting symbols on mingw32

	Add missing deps for gobject introspection
	Add RPM specfile BRs for gobject introspection support

2010-07-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Replace getline with fgets for win32 portability
	The getline function is gnu specific. Replace with use of fgets
	for portability to win32

	Make use of termios.h conditional, to fix win32 builds
	Win32 does not have termios support to disable terminal echo.
	Disable that code until a better solution can be found.

	Drop autoconf version back to 2.63
	Fedora 12 only has autoconf 2.63. Drop back minimum version to
	allow this usage

2010-07-05  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Fix dead framebuffer refresh after psuedo encodings
	Users of VncConnection are responsible for requesting framebuffer
	updates after every framebuffer update, resize of pixel encoding
	change. Other pseudo encodings are not visible to users of the
	VncConnection class, so a framebuffer update request must be
	re-requested if one of these psuedo encodings arrives

	Fix parallel build with introspection data
	THe GVnc introspection data must be built before GtkVnc data.

	Add a gvnccapture command line tool
	Add a command line tool for capturing a screenshot of a VNC
	desktop

	Change vnc_connection_framebuffer_update_request to use boolean
	Use a boolean for the incremental parameter in the
	vnc_connection_framebuffer_update_request API

	When using 32bpp, depth 24 fill alpha byte.
	When constructing a GdkPixbuf from the framebuffer pixel array,
	it will expect the alpha bits to be initialized to a sensible
	value. Since we don't care about alpha, make sure 32bpp, depth 24
	format sets alpha to 0xff (full opaque).

	Fix emitting of unsupported auth signal
	The vnc_connection_set_auth_type method is invoked from the system
	coroutine, so it must directly emit the signal, not use the delayed
	signal emitter

	Change vnc_connection_key_event to use a boolean
	Use a boolean for the down flag in the vnc_connection_key_event#
	API.

	Add padding to GObject classes
	To allow the class structs to be expanded later without breaking
	ABI it is neccessary to include padding in the structs. If extra
	fields are later added, an equivalent amount padding must be
	remnoved

2010-06-30  Jonh Wendell  <jwendell@gnome.org>

	Allows linking with gtk+2.0 and gtk+3.0
	This adds a new configure parameter: --with-gtk=2.0|3.0 (default: 2.0)

	Prepare for gtk+ >= 2.22
	This uses accessors instead of accessing struct members

2010-06-29  Jonh Wendell  <jwendell@gnome.org>

	Fixed GOBJECT flags

2010-06-26  Gil Forcada  <gforcada@gnome.org>

	Added Catalan translation

2010-06-22  Jonh Wendell  <jwendell@gnome.org>

	Only handle motion events when initialized.
	Closes #622429.

2010-06-17  Michal Novotny  <minovotn@redhat.com>

	Add APIs for configurable key grab sequences
	Allow the key grab sequence to be configured by applications.
	The grab sequence is represented by a new boxed data object

	  VncGrabSequence

	This can be created from an array of keysyms

	  guint keys[] = { GDK_Control_L, GDK_Alt_L };
	  guint len = sizeof(keys)/sizeof(keys[0]);
	  vnc_grab_sequence_new(len, keys);

	Or from a string format

	  vnc_grab_sequence_new_from_string("Control_L+Alt_L");

	The gvncviewer.c example program shows a user interface for
	configuring key sequences. The gvncviewer.py example program
	demonstrates access from the python binding.

	This patch is heavily based on the original proposal from
	Michal Novotny

2010-06-17  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Add support for colourmap based pixel formats
	The current code will force the server to use the native
	client's pixel format if it ever sees a pixel format
	with true_color_flag==0 (ie colourmap).  This is bad because
	the client native pixel format is almost always 32bpp while
	the main reason for using a colourmap is to get bandwidth
	friendly 8bpp format. This makes GTK-VNC look bad in any
	performance comparisons.

	This patch implements full support for rendering from
	colourmaps. It introduces a boxed data type to store the
	colour map entries and wires this upto the framebuffer
	interface.

	For rendering, the BLT functions for the VncBaseFramebuffer
	are enhanced to cope with colourmaps. Since colour maps
	provide 16bit r,g,b triples, the BLT code is enhanced to
	cope with 64-bit bpp pixels. This is technically required
	even for non-colourmap entries since the VNC pixel format
	protocol message allows for 16 bit r,g,b masks which
	results in a 64-bit true colour pixel.

	* src/vnccolormap.h, src/vnccolormap.c, src/Makefile.am: Add
	  a VncColorMap boxed data type to hold the colour map entries.
	* src/vncframebuffer.h, src/vncframebuffer.c: Add an API to
	  the VncFrameBuffer interface to allow the colour map to be
	  updated.
	* src/vncconnection.h, src/vncconnection.c: Remove last case
	  of vnc_ops and replace with new VncColorMap object
	* src/vncdisplay.c: Don't override the default server pixel
	  format, allow use of colour maps
	* src/vncbaseframebuffer.c, src/vncbaseframebufferblt.h: Add
	  support for rendering pixels using a colourmap

	Fix off by 1 in initial protocol greeting
	The client -> server greeting must be 12 bytes long, ending in a
	newline character. An off-by-1 in snprintf resulted in the 12th
	byte being a NULL instead. This caused wireshark to not detect
	the stream as VNC

	Fix the vnc_connection_set_encodings method write
	The vnc_connection_set_encodings method is a public API which is
	called from the system coroutine. Thus is must use the buffered
	write routines.

	Fix crash in server cut text
	GString needs to be freed with g_string_free rather than g_free.
	Fix the signature of the cut text callback

2010-06-11  Jonh Wendell  <jwendell@gnome.org>

	Build with GSEAL. Closes #612727.
	Now we require gtk+ 2.18.

	Try next DNS addr after all connect failures
	There are many more ways an IPv6 connection can fail than just
	CONNREFUSED and HOSTUNREACH. For example ETIMEDOUT, NETUNREACH
	and more. Try the next DNS addr after all connect() failures,
	no matter what the errno code, to ensure we always fallback
	to IPv4 eventually.

	* src/vncconnection.c: Retry connection after all errors

2010-04-25  Takeshi AIHANA  <takeshi.aihana@gmail.com>

2010-03-22  Halton Huo  <halton.huo@sun.com>

	Conditional use JRI stuff in npupp.h
	Since 3.6, firefox does not ship jri.h, so remove it from npupp.h
	as GTK-VNC does not need it

	Add -lgpg-error to linker flags
	The gcrypt.h file has several inline functions which cause code
	using gcrypt to have a direct link time dependancy on gpg-error,
	if the compiler decides to inline. Thus we need to add -lgpg-error
	to the linker flags to cope with potential inlining

	* configure.ac: Add -lgpg-error to GNUTLS_LIBS

2010-03-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Use --no-undefined instead of -no-undefined
	Solaris can't cope with -no-undefined, and even Linux prefers the
	--no-undefined style.

2010-03-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Turn on debug in javascript example program
	* src/Makefile.am: Include vncutil.h/.c in introspection processing
	* examples/gvncviewer.js: Enable debugging

	Fix include files / libs in new RPM split
	The gvnc-devel package mistakenly included the gtk-vnc include
	directory. The gtk-vnc package mistakenly included the gvnc.so
	library

	Support GObject introspection & add javascript demo program
	Add Makefile.am rules to generate a typelib with introspection
	data. Add a javascript demo program to show how trivial it is.

	Turn VncPixelFormat into a boxed type
	To allow introspection to work with VncPixelFormat properties,
	this struct needs to be a boxed type

	Split up library into libgvnc.so (GObject) bits and libgtk-vnc.so (GTK widget)
	The libgvnc.so library comprises the classes

	  VncConnection
	  VncPixelFormat
	  VncFramebuffer
	  VncBaseFramebuffer
	  VncCursor
	  VncConnection

	This only depends on glib, gobject and gdk-pixbuf

	The libgtk-vnc.so library comprises the classes

	  VncDisplay
	  VncImageFramebuffer

	Adding a dependancy on GTK

	Update copyright headers after last round of object refactoring
	In the major 20-patch series of object refactoring, the copyright
	headers were mistakenly not updated. Add extra copyright header to
	reflect the work done

	Introduce a function for setting debug flag in prep for library split
	The base APIs will soon be split into a separate libgvnc.so library.
	Since libgtk-vnc.so exposes the --gtk-vnc-debug flag, this needs to
	be implemented using an API in the libgvnc.so library, rather than
	just a static boolean flag in vncdisplay.c

	The GVNC_DEBUG macros is also renamed to VNC_DEBUG

	* vncutil.c, vncutil.h: New file for vnc_util_set_debug(gboolean)
	* utils.h: Remove old debug flag
	* dh.c, vncbaseframebuffer.c, vncconnection.c, vncdisplay.c,
	  vncdisplaykeymap.c, vncimageframebuffer.c: s/GVNC_DEBUG/VNC_DEBUG/
	* Makefile.am: Add vncutil.h/.c files

	Avoid crash if framebuffer is not set & silence warning
	* src/vncdisplay.c: Avoid possible crash if framebuffer isn't set
	* src/vncconnection.c: Avoid warning when sasl is not enabled

	Move all coroutine stuff into VncConnection
	The VncDisplay class currently runs the main coroutine for the
	VncConnection. This means some VncConnection APIs need to be
	invoked from the VNC coroutine context, while others need to be
	invoked from the main system context. This will make the
	VncConnection class very hard to use from non-C languages like
	Python/Perl/Java/etc.

	Move all the coroutine code into the VncConnection class. All
	its APIs are now to be invoked from system context. This means
	it can now easily be used from any language

	Move X keycode -> PC scancode conversion into VncDisplay
	The VncConnection class should not depend on anything from GDK.
	The X keycode to PC scancode conversion uses GDK. Therefore it
	had to be moved into the VncDisplay class

	Rename enums from GVNC_ to VNC_CONNECTION_
	Rename the symbols for the VncConnectionEncoding, VncConnectionAuth
	and VncConnectionAuthVencrypt enums to use a prefix of

	new 'vnc-auth-credential' signal

	Remove 'get_preferred_pixel_format' operation
	Remove the 'get_preferred_pixel_format' operation callback, and
	instead directly set the pixel format (if desired) during the
	initialization phase of the coroutine

	Replace 'auth_failure' and 'auth_unsupported' operations with signals
	Remove the 'auth_failure' and 'auth_unsupported' operation callbacks
	from VncConnection. Introduce new 'vnc-auth-failure' and
	'vnc-auth-unsupported' signals.

	Replace 'update', 'resize' and 'pixel_format' operation callbacks with signals
	Remove the 'update', 'resize' and 'pixel_format' operation callbacks
	from VncConnection. Introduce new 'vnc-framebuffer-update',
	'vnc-desktop-resize' and 'vnc-pixel-format-changed' signals

	Replace 'server_cut_text' operation with a signal
	Remove the 'server_cut_text' operation from VncConnection.
	Introduce a signal 'vnc-server-cut-text' for VncConnection and
	pass in the text

	Replace 'bell' operation with a signal
	Remove the 'bell' operation callback from VncConnection.
	Introduce a signal 'vnc-bell' for VncConnection.

	Replace 'pointer_type_changed' operation with a signal
	Remove the 'pointer_type_changed' operation callback from VncConnection.
	Introduce a signal 'vnc-pointer-mode-changed' and pass it the pointer
	state as a gboolean

	Replace 'local_cursor' operation callback with a signal

	Introduce a VncCursor object to represent a client side rendered
	pointer

	Tidy up header files to have consistent coding style

	Convert VncConnection into a proper GObject type

	Generate enum types for VncConnection enums

	Convert VncConnection over to use VncFramebuffer object
	Remove the vnc_framebuffer struct, and make VncConnection use the
	new VncFramebuffer object.

	VncDisplay is changed to use the VncImageFramebuffer object
	type as its implementation of VncFramebuffer

	Add a framebuffer implementation based on a GdkImage
	Subclass the VncBaseFramebuffer class to add an implementation
	which uses a GdkImage as its local storage

	Add a VncFrameBuffer interface and basic implementation
	Define the interface for a framebuffer and rendering into it
	between local & remote pixel formats.

	Provide a basic implementation of the interface using simple
	blt functions for a local memory region

	Pull pixel format struct out into a separate file with typedef
	Turn struct vnc_pixel_format into VncPixelFormat type

	Rename gvnc module to prepare for turning into public GObjects

	Remove use of 'widget->window' in favour of gtk_widget_get_window()
	When building using -DGSEAL_ENABLE, the 'widget->window' field is
	not available. Instead the gtk_widget_get_window() method must be
	used

	* configure.ac: Bump dep on GTK to 2.14
	* src/vncdisplay.c: Switch to gtk_widget_get_window()

2010-03-20  Emilio Pozuelo Monfort  <pochu27@gmail.com>

2010-03-20  Michal Suchanek  <hramrach@centrum.cz>

	Improve error message in gvncviewer when connection fails
	The 'vnc-disconnected' signal is emitted both when a connection
	closes, and when a connection fails to initialize at all. The
	gvncviewer demo was not taking account of this, so providing a
	misleading diagnostic message

	* examples/gvncviewer.c: Distinguish errors conditions in

	in gtk-vnc.

	* configure.ac: Remove redundant check for NSPR

2010-03-20  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add plugin to .gitignore files

2010-03-20  Halton Huo  <halton.huo@sun.com>

	Pull in npapi.h & npupp.h from FF3 source to fix plugin build
	Latest versions of firefox do not provide the npapi.h/npupp.h
	files that the plugin requires to build. Copy those files from
	the FF3 source tree into plugin to provide compatability.

	* plugin/npapi.h, plugin/npupp.h: Pull in from FF3 source tree

2010-03-20  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Add -Wl since --no-undefined is a linker option
	The --no-undefined option was not being processed correctly, since
	it needs a -Wl prefix to be passed through to the linker

	* src/Makefile.am: Add -Wl to --no-undefined arg

	Explicitly link against X11 libs for XkbGetKeyboard
	When building with --no-undefined and modern linkers, X11 won't
	be found implicitly. Therefore it is neccessary to link directly
	to X11

	* configure.ac: Use pkgconfig to check for X11 libs
	* src/Makefile.am: Link against X11

	Fix symbol versioning script application
	* src/Makefile.am: Drop space after -Wl, in libgtk_vnc_1_0_la_LDFLAGS
	  to ensure linker script is applied

	Add missing symbols
	* src/libgtk-vnc_sym.version: Add missing symbols from 0.3.8
	  and 0.3.9 releases

	Remove use of stdint in favour of GLib fixed size types
	GLib provides guint8, gint8, guint16, gint16, guint32, gint32
	data types. Use these instead of stdint.h, so we better follow
	standard GLibc practice.

	Include po files in RPM builds
	* gtk-vnc.spec.in, mingw32-gtk-vnc.spec.in: Use %lang related macros
	  to pull in po files to RPM

	Re-write configure rules to avoid many warnings
	* acinclude.m4: Add helper function for checking a huge list of
	  compile flags. Also test ability to link with the flag, not just
	  to compile.
	* configure.ac: gl_EARLY must come before every rule that isnt
	  just autoconf/make metadata initialization. Call out to the
	  generic compile flag macro. Turn off automake's GNU-make-ism
	  warnings.
	* autobuild.sh: Change way compile warnings are turned on
	* src/Makefile.am: Enable compile warning flags on python build

	Add separate m4 dir to avoid intltool/libtool splattering over gnulib
	If no generic -I m4 directory is listed, libtool & intltool will
	splatter their files all over those belonging to gnulib. This gives
	wierd, unpredictable build errors depending on whose file was copied
	over most recently.

	* Makefile.am: Add -I m4 flag

	Invoke intltoolize in autogen.sh

	options, returned by gtk-vnc into their own groups. This makes
	things flexible.
