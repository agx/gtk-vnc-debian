propagated and ensures that the right number of encodings are sent to the
server.  This release also fixes the RichCursor encoding when the server is
using a depth of less than 24.

A new interface was added (vnc_display_send_keys_ex) for passing key press and
key release sequences directly and for sending pointer events directly
(vnc_display_send_pointer).  Another interface was added
(vnc_display_set_read_only) to prevent the user from being able to send any
input at all to the server.  Support for the RRE encoding was added along
with a GThread-based coroutine implementation to improve portability.  ZRLE
support was also added.

pending I/O waits. Added destructor to widget to ensure all
resources are free'd when the widget is deleted.
